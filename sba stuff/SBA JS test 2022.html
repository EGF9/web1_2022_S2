            Complete the full names! You have been given an array of firstNames and an array of lastNames.
            
            1. As efficiently as possible, combine the appropriate names and add them to the fullNames array. (3 marks)

                The array should be like this when done:

                [
                    "Donald Trump",
                    "Kim Kardashian",
                    "Melania Trump",
                    "Khloe Kardashian",
                    "Ivanka Trump",
                    "Kourtney Kardashian"
                ]

            2. Sort the fullNames array so all the Kardashians appear first (in slots 0, 1, 2) and the Trumps are
            second (in slot 3, 4, 5). (3 marks)

                HINT: You can split the fullNames by the ' ' (space) character using the .split(" ") function of a string...
                It will return an array of the two names...
                So, in your sort method, you could split each name, access the [1] of the resulting array, and use that to
                do the sort.

        let firstNames = [
            "Donald",
            "Kim",

            "Ivanka",
            "Kourtney"
        ];

        let fullNames = [];

        /* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */
        for(let i = 0; i < firstNames; i++)

            let x = 1;
            if(lastNames[x] > 1)
            {
                x = 0;
