    <p> Tātai is a place where Māori can share iwi affiliations, with iwi, and the Ministry of 
    <p>Health, to make a positive difference today, and for future generations. It is a data 
    <p>collection tool that will provide iwi with much better health information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing your iwi affiliations is a way to ensure we, as Māori, are contributing to 
        worthwhile and high-quality datasets about iwi, for iwi. Tātai has been created in
        partnership with Māori, for Māori.

    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>About
        The Government has struggled to provide iwi with high quality health information about their people, but knows that needs to change.
        
        With good health information iwi can influence and advocate for a health system that keeps people healthy and supports us all to deliver greater equity for Māori.
        
        With good health information iwi can make data informed decisions around how to invest in the wellbeing of iwi, hapū and whānau.
        
        Sharing your iwi affiliations with us contributes to a dataset that can be used to maximise our potential as Māori.
        
        The need for data that is reliable, timely, relevant, available and accessible for Māori and iwi has never been so important.
        
        The information that is collected will be provided to iwi to help inform and strengthen iwi strategies, and progress towards their self-determined vision and outcomes. The government will also use it to support more equitable health outcomes for Māori.
        
        It is also an opportunity for iwi to connect you and other people who share a similar whakapapa and iwi and get a better understanding of where they are across Aotearoa.
        
        Quote by Māori participant in Tātai research:
        Iwi affiliation data could help the younger generation know where they are from and aid in the reclamation of culture that we are already seeing.

            Strengthen Datasets about Māori
            This is an opportunity to contribute your iwi information to a dataset about the population and growth of your iwi.

            With the collection of this data iwi can use the information as a tool to understand iwi population status and better understand where Māori, iwi, hapū and whānau live, so that the delivery of resources and services can be coordinated more easily and Māori have access to services faster and more efficiently.

            Iwi Resourcing
            We know that there is a greater need to ensure that iwi are adequately resourced to provide greater opportunities for what Māori can be empowered to do and how iwi can be better supported.

            Collecting and updating iwi affiliation data will enable iwi to have more quality data to plan where to put resources and develop programmes, services and interventions by Māori, for Māori.

            Future Outcomes
            Contributing to this kaupapa gives your iwi better information to plan ahead and it will help Māori have the autonomy to implement initiatives, processes, and address areas of need & concern as defined, and as witnessed by iwi.

            It is a way to raise the levels of equity and development for our people, and address areas of need.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we are to determine our destiny (an expression of tino rangatiratanga) having such crucial info on our health and well being will assist us to address real areas of priority.
